# Medical LLM Assistant (LoRA Fine-Tuned)
## Overview
This project builds a domain-specific medical assistant by fine-tuning a pre-trained Large Language Model using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation).
The assistant specializes in answering USMLE-style medical questions and demonstrates improved clinical reasoning compared to the base model.

## Objectives
Fine-tune a generative LLM on medical QA data
Use parameter-efficient fine-tuning (QLoRA)
Evaluate using BLEU, ROUGE, and Perplexity
Compare base vs fine-tuned model
Deploy via Streamlit web interface

## Domain
Healthcare – Clinical Question Answering
Dataset: MedQA (USMLE 4-option MCQs)

## Model
Base Model: TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat
Fine-tuning Method: LoRA (r=16)
Quantization: 4-bit NF4
Trainer: TRL SFTTrainer

## Installation
!pip install transformers datasets peft accelerate bitsandbytes trl evaluate rouge_score gradio  sacrebleu evaluate streamlit pyngrok


## Run Notebook (Colab)
Open the notebook in Google Colab and run all cells sequentially.
Training takes ~90 minutes on a T4 GPU.
